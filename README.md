# Team Profile
### Siddharth Desai
## Description
The purpose of this project was to build a command-line base application to generate a team profile html page. The user will be prompted with a series of questions through the command line using Inquirer and their answers are later used to generate the HTML page. The profiles are broken down into three role types: manager, intern and engineer. The user is only allowed one manager however has the ability to add as many interns and engineers as desired. Once the user is done adding interns and engineer profiles they can select “Finish building my team” in the command line options and this will generate the final HTML team profile page.
